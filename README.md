# contactlistapp
Fully integrated MEAN stack application
Allows for full CRUD operation on a Mongo DB with Angular on the client side and NodeJS/Express on the server (API) side.

Also demonstrates HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE functionality in the API.

This is a really <b>crude</b> CRUD. No separation of Church and State.
Bit difficult to convert to mongoose due to lack of matching tutorials.
Would work much better if the MVC was separated.
Works now however.
